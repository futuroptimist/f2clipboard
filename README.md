# f2clipboard v2 – "flows to clipboard"

## Problem
Repetitive web-based engineering chores (triaging CI failures, gathering logs, summarising errors) steal focus and time. Existing tooling (e.g. OpenAI Operator) is deprecated or proprietary.

## Vision
A single CLI command
```bash
f2clipboard codex-task https://chatgpt.com/codex/tasks/task_123…
```
should:

Parse the Codex task page (authenticated session or scraped HTML via Playwright).

Locate the linked GitHub PR (“View PR” button).

Query the GitHub API for the check-suite:

For every failed check → download full raw logs.

For every successful check → ignore.

If a log exceeds 150 kB → invoke an LLM (configurable, OpenAI or Anthropic) to summarise the failure.

Secrets such as API tokens are redacted from logs before summarisation or output.

Emit a Markdown snippet ready for pasting back into Codex:

Each failed check becomes a fenced code-block labelled with job name & link.

Oversized logs are replaced by the summary plus a collapsible <details> section with the first 100 lines for context.

The original local file workflow is still available via the `files` command:

```bash
f2clipboard files --dir path/to/project
```

## Roadmap
### M0 (bootstrap)
- [x] Ship basic CLI with `codex-task` command and help text.
- [x] Support GitHub personal-access tokens via `.env`.
- [x] Fetch PR URL from Codex task HTML (unauthenticated test page).

### M1 (minimum lovable product)
- [x] Parse check-suites with GitHub REST v3. 💯
- [x] Download raw logs; gzip-decode when necessary. 💯
- [x] Size-gate logs → summarise via LLM. 💯
- [x] Write Markdown artefact to `stdout` **and** clipboard. 💯

### M2 (hardening)
- [ ] Playwright headless login for private Codex tasks.
- [x] Unit tests (pytest + `pytest-recording` vcr). 💯
- [x] Secret scanning & redaction (via custom regex; GitHub `ghp_` and OpenAI `sk-` keys). 💯

### M3 (extensibility)
- [x] Plugin interface (`entry_points = "f2clipboard.plugins"`). 💯
- [x] First plugin: Jira ticket summariser. 💯
- [ ] VS Code task provider / GitHub Action marketplace listing.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/futuroptimist/f2clipboard
cd f2clipboard
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env  # fill in your tokens
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for log summarisation
```

Generate a Markdown snippet for a Codex task:

```bash
f2clipboard codex-task https://chatgpt.com/codex/tasks/task_123
```

The resulting Markdown is printed to your terminal and copied to the clipboard.
To skip copying to the clipboard, pass ``--no-clipboard``:

```bash
f2clipboard codex-task https://chatgpt.com/codex/tasks/task_123 --no-clipboard
```

Copy selected files from a local repository:

```bash
f2clipboard files --dir path/to/project
```

## Plugins

f2clipboard loads plugins registered under the `f2clipboard.plugins` entry-point group. A plugin
exposes a callable that receives the Typer app and can register additional commands.

```toml
[project.entry-points."f2clipboard.plugins"]
hello = "my_package.plugin:register"
```

The first bundled plugin summarises Jira issues:

```bash
f2clipboard jira path/to/issue.json
```

Provide either a Jira issue URL or a path to a JSON export. The ticket's description is summarised
and copied to your clipboard.
